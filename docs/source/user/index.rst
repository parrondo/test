Install Guide
=============

.. note::

    It is best practice to install run Python projects in a virtual
    environment, which can be created and activated as follows using
    Python 3.6+.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python -m venv venv
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        (venv) $ pip install test

The simplest way to install test is using Pip.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install test

This will install ``test`` and all of its dependencies.
